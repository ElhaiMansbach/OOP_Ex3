## This project was made during our OOP course at Ariel University in the Department of Computer Science, 2021.

### Made by: Elhai Mansbach & Lioz Akirav.

**In this project we implemented a weighted directed graph accompanied by different graphs algorithms in Python.<br/>
We used two interfaces to implement the graph properties and we implemented the graph by three classes.<br/>**


## Data Structures:

### NodeData:<br/>
This class represents the set of operations applicable on a node in an directed weighted graph.<br/>
Each node has a unique key plus four additional node fields (weight, position , tag and information) that were used only during the algorithms.<br/>

### DiGraph:<br/>
*The GraphInterface interface is implemented in DiGraph class:*<br/>
This class represents an directional weighted graph.<br/>
It supports over 10^6 vertices, with an average degree of 10.<br/>
The nodes and the edges are implemented in a data structure â€“ Dictionary.<br/>
The class include these functions:
* v_size - Returns the number of vertices in this graph.
* e_size - Returns the number of edges in this graph.
* get_all_v - Returns a dictionary of all the nodes in the graph.
* all_in_edges_of_node - Returns a dictionary of all the nodes connected to the given node_id.
* all_out_edges_of_node - Returns a dictionary of all the nodes connected from the given node_id.
* get_mc - Returns the number of changes that made in the graph.
* add_edge - Adds an edge to the graph.
* add_node - Adds a node to the graph.
* get_node - Gets a node's key and returns the NodeData.
* remove_node - Removes a node from the graph.
* remove_edge - Removes an edge from the graph.


### GraphAlgo:<br/>
*The GraphAlgoInterface interface is implemented in GraphAlgo class:*<br/>
The Graph_Algo object contains a graph to activate the algorithms on.<br/>

**This class represents the Graph Theory algorithms including:**<br/>
1. **__init__:** Init this set of algorithms on a given graph<br/>
2. **get_graph:** Return the underlying graph of which this class works<br/>
3. **shortest_path:** Returns the shortest path from node id1 to node id2.<br/>
4. **connected_component:** Finds the Strongly Connected Component(SCC) that node id1 is a part of.<br/>
5. **connected_components:** Finds all the Strongly Connected Component(SCC) in the graph.<br/>
6. **save_to_json:** Saves this weighted directed graph to the given file name - in JSON format.<br/>
7. **load_from_json:** Loads the graph from the file.<br/>
8. **plot_graph:** Plots the graph.<br/>
9. **clear:** PClears the graph  and initializes all the nodes in the graph to their default values.<br/>
10 .**dijkstra:** Algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph.<br/>
11 .**shortest_path_distance:** Returns the shortest distance between two given nodes.<br/>
12 .**is_numeric:** The method gets a string and checks if its contains a number.<br/>
